# HDR+ Implementation
Original Document on the subject (by Timothy Brooks): http://timothybrooks.com/tech/hdr-plus

### Compilation instructions:
1. Install libraw, libpng, and libjpeg.¹
2. Download and compile llvm 3.9
3. Install or compile the latest version Halide
4. Go the folder you have the hdr-plus code in.
5. From the project root directory, run the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DHALIDE_DISTRIB_DIR=$(Insert halide directory) ..
make -j$(expr $(nproc) \+ 1)
```

### HDR+ algorithm examples:

Timothy Brooks provided images but they had to be taken off of Google Drive because the user titaniumtown doesn't have any space for it. If you have any suggestions, please contact titaniumtown.

### Compiled Binary Usage:
```
Usage: ./hdrplus [-c comp -g gain (optional)] dir_path out_img raw_img1 raw_img2 [...]
```

The -c and -g flags change the amount of dynamic range compression and gain respectively. Although they are optional because they both have default values. 

### Footnotes:
  
¹Also to install libraw, libpng, and libjpeg on macOS run ```brew install libraw libpng libjpeg```
